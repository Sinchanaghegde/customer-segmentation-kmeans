Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

📌 Project Overview

Customer segmentation is an essential task in marketing and business analytics that involves dividing customers into meaningful groups based on their behaviors, demographics, and purchasing patterns.

This project leverages K-Means Clustering, a popular unsupervised machine learning algorithm, to automatically identify distinct customer groups. By understanding these segments, businesses can tailor marketing strategies, improve customer retention, and enhance overall decision-making.

🚀 Features

Data Preprocessing – Cleaning, transforming, and preparing the dataset for clustering analysis.

K-Means Clustering – Implementation of the K-Means algorithm to partition customers into distinct clusters.

Evaluation Metrics – Silhouette Score, Inertia (Elbow Method) to determine the optimal number of clusters.

Visualization – Scatter plots, Silhouette plots, and cluster visualizations for better interpretation.

Insights & Interpretation – Analysis of clusters to derive actionable business insights.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Language: Python

Libraries:

pandas, numpy – Data processing

matplotlib, seaborn – Data visualization

scikit-learn – Machine learning (K-Means, metrics, preprocessing)

📊 Workflow

Data Collection – Import dataset (customer demographics, transactions, or behavioral data).

Data Preprocessing – Handle missing values, scale features, and encode categorical data.

Clustering – Apply K-Means clustering with different K values.

Evaluation – Use the Elbow Method and Silhouette Score to choose the best K.

Visualization – Plot customer segments to understand grouping.

Insights – Interpret results to help in decision-making.
